<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I'm using [Advent of Code](advent-of-code) to help build up my Rust programming
skills.

Currently working on getting through [2021](2021/)

> NB: Solutions to [2020](2020/) were originally written in python. I
> will one day redo these problems in rust.
